✅ Interpretation (how to explain in class)
🔴 1. The most disadvantaged region

Béni Mellal-Khénifra has the highest illiteracy AND largest gender inequality

Rural, mountainous, weak infrastructure

🟠 2. Medium problem regions

Drâa-Tafilalet, Marrakech-Safi, Fès-Meknès, Oriental

Still high gender gaps → targeted policy needed

🟢 3. Best-performing regions

Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab & Laâyoune-Sakia El Hamra

Very low illiteracy

Gender gap is nearly closed or reversed → women literacy is strong

✅ Policy Message (realistic takeaway)

“The education problem in Morocco is not national, it is regional and gendered.
The worst affected are women in rural central regions.”
