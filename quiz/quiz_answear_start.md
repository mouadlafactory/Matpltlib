Of course ✅
Here are the correct answers with explanations, **keeping all options visible**, and explaining *why* the correct one is best.

## ✅ Question 1

**If you need to represent changes or trends over time, which type of graph would be most appropriate?**

a) Bar Graph
**b) Line Graph ✅**
c) Histogram

✅ **Why?**
A **line graph** is best for showing how a value evolves **over time** (daily, monthly, yearly). It highlights trends, increases/decreases, and patterns.
Bar charts compare categories, and histograms show distributions — neither shows *time trends* as well as line graphs.

## ✅ Question 2

**When comparing quantities across different categories, which graph should you choose?**

a) Scatter Plot
**b) Bar Graph ✅**
c) Line Graph

✅ **Why?**
A **bar graph** is ideal for comparing **distinct categories** (e.g., city vs energy use, region vs literacy rate).
Scatter plots show relationships between two *numerical* variables, not categories.
Line graphs show changes *over time*, not comparisons between groups.

## ✅ Question 3

**To illustrate the distribution of a continuous dataset, such as the range of temperatures over a month, which visualization is best?**

**a) Histogram ✅**
b) Bubble Chart
c) Treemap

✅ **Why?**
A **histogram** shows how values are distributed across intervals (bins), which is perfect for continuous data like temperature, income, age, etc.
Bubble charts show relationships between 3 variables.
Treemaps are for hierarchical proportions, not statistical distribution.

## ✅ Question 4

**For visualizing hierarchical data as a set of nested rectangles to show proportions, what type of chart would you use?**

**a) Treemap ✅**
b) Bubble Chart
c) Heatmap

✅ **Why?**
A **Treemap** is designed specifically for **hierarchical** data (Parent → Child → Subgroup), displaying proportions using nested rectangles.
A bubble chart shows magnitude using circles (not hierarchy).
A heatmap shows intensity (color scale), typically in a matrix/grid.

| Question | Correct    | Why                                       |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Line Graph | Shows **trends over time**                |
| 2        | Bar Graph  | Compares **different categories**         |
| 3        | Histogram  | Shows **distribution** of continuous data |
| 4        | Treemap    | Shows **hierarchy + proportions**         |
